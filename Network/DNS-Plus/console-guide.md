### Create a DNS Zone

1. A DNS Zone is a container for record sets, which is a domain zone for hosts served by DNS. Click **Create DNS Zone** to create a DNS Zone.

2. Enter **DNS Zone Name** and **Description**, and click **Confirm**.  

    - In **DNS Zone Name**, enter the domain or subdomain you own as [fully qualified domain name (FQDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name).
    - **DNS Zone Name** must be unique on the DNS server.
    - The same **DNS Zone Name** can be created as many as the number of DNS servers. There are 3 DNS servers.
    - After the DNS Zone is created, you must set the name server information of the NS record set that is created by default to the domain. For the record sets created by default, see [Manage Record Sets](./console-guide/#manage-record-sets).
        - If the DNS Zone was created with a newly registered domain, you must set the name server information to the corresponding name server in the domain registrar.
        - If the DNS Zone was created with a subdomain of a domain currently in operation, you must create an NS record set in your operating domain with the subdomain name and its name server.

        - FAILOVER: Performs routing based on the priorities of connected pools.
        - RANDOM: Performs routing by randomly selecting an available pool among connected pools.
        - GEOLOCATION: Routes the traffic of the configured region to the connected pool. When there is no configured region, performs routing based on the priorities of connected pools.
    - TTL (seconds): Time to live, which indicates the validity period of the data. Enter the update cycle of the GSLB domain (in seconds). You can enter a value easily by clicking the buttons on the right.
    - Status: Choose whether to activate the GSLB domain.

### Connect a Pool

Configure a pool to connect to GSLB.

1. Click **Connect Pool**.

2. In the **Connect Pool** dialog box, select a pool to connect to and enter the setting information according to the routing rule.

    - Priority: The smaller the number, the higher the routing order. If the same priority as the previously connected pool is entered, the routing order of the existing pool is lowered. Set when the routing rule is FAILOVER or GEOLOCATION.
    - Region: Routes traffic of the configured region to the connected pool. Set when the routing rule is GEOLOCATION.
Example: If a pool is connected to GSLB as shown in the table below
        - In case of FAILOVER, it will be routed to Pool-A.
        - In case of GEOLOCATION, if the client is in the Northeast Asia region, it will be routed to Pool-B.
        - In case of GEOLOCATION, if the client is in the Western North America region, it is routed to Pool-C.
        - In case of GEOLOCATION, if the client is in the Western Europe region, it is routed to Pool-A by priority because there is no configure region.

    | Pool name | Priority | Region |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Pool-A | 1 |  |
    | Pool-B | 2 | Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia |
    | Pool-C | 3 | Western North America |

3. Click **Confirm**.

4. There is a limit to the maximum number of pools that can be connected. If you want to raise the limit, please contact us.
