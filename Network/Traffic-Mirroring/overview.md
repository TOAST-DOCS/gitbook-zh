## Network > Traffic Mirroring > Overview

Network packets in VPC can be captured and routed to detection tools for purposes such as content security, threat analysis, and troubleshooting.
Traffic Mirroring, with detection tools, allows you to quickly detect and respond to attacks and meet various security compliance requirements.

## Main Features
