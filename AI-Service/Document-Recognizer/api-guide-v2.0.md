### Overview of v2.0 API

#### Changes from v1.0

1. Enhanced security with the electronic envelope method.

#### Domain

| Name | Domain |
| --- | --- |
| OCR Public API Domain | [https://ocr.api.nhncloudservice.com](https://ocr.api.nhncloudservice.com) |

#### Prerequisites (AppKey, SecretKey)

* AppKey and SecretKey are required to use the API.
* You can find the {appKey} and {secretKey} in the **URL & Appkey** menu at the top of the console.

#### Caution

* Check whether the request or response is Base64 encoded.
* Check the detailed mode of encryption and decryption (eg AES-256/CBC/PKCS7Padding).
* The symmetric key used for encryption must be generated as a 32-byte random number.

### Issue Public Key

#### Request

* You can find the {appKey} and {secretKey} in the **URL & Appkey** menu at the top of the console.
