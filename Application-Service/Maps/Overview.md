A variety of features are available, including easy and precise maps, search, and getting directions. 

## Main Features


### Maps API

- Maps API based on JavaScript 
    - Vector maps and aerial maps are available easy and fast on the web page.
    - Using both WebGL and vector files allows flawless zoom-in/out of high resolution and supports various visualization effects between the background map and data layer.  
    - More than 230 features are supported, including map movement, rotation, tilting, zoom-in/out, marker, information window, figures, changing map types, and converting coordinates. 
- Mobile Maps SDK 
    - Maps SDKs are available both on Android and iOS, so that most optimized mobile app services can be developed. 
    - A variety of classes and methods are supported to implement map features on mobile apps. 
    - Distinct cycle and geographical space data are optimized to the resolution for display.   

### Integrated Search

- Integrated Search 
    - Search is available by business name, phone number, or address (by lot number or road name). 
- Various Search Services
    - A variety of search services are supported, including search of recommended words, or sub-facilities.

## Glossary

|Term| Description |
|---|---|
| WGS84 Latitude/Longitude Coordinates | Coordinates enabled by WGS84 spheroid: spherical coordinates to latitude or longitude |
| TW Coordinates | Coordinate system on Thinware maps (ThinkWare coordinates) |
| TM Coordinates | With the location of a random area as origin point of coordinate, the meridian traversing the origin point on the plane is displayed as axis X while the parallel between the east and west as axis Y, so that each location can be marked by m under the rectangular coordinate system. |
| Map Cycle | Data exposing information on the background map: information which is exposed properly so as to recognize information on each location, such as administrative names, business names, public institutions, water system, and road name. |
| General/Aerial Maps | General Map: Maps with general background data which are optimized for PC web maps  <br>Aerial Maps: Maps that are photographed on airplane <br>
| Administrative Codes | Codes that are stipulated in accordance with procedures from standardized administrative codes which are required for tasks of each institution so that information can be shared between institutions |
| Old Address System (based on land-lot numbers) | Land-based address system, like Dong, Li + lot number |
| Road Name Address System | Building-based address system, like road name + building number |
| Space Search | Search within area or radius <br>Extent Search: Search within areas on top-left coordinates (X,Y)/bottom-right coordinates (X,Y) <br>Range Search: Search within radius from central coordinates |
| POI | Short for Point of Interest, which refers to buildings or stores which are marked on electronic maps, like navigation  |
| Sub-facilities | Facilities included at each POI (e.g. Sub-facilities of Everland: Parking lot 1A , Parking lot 1B) |
| Stopover | A location which is passed by between departure and destination |
| Keyhole Markup Language, or KML | XML standard-based file format to mark geographical data <br>Developed for Google Earth and now supported for many services, such as Google and HERE Map.  |
| GPS Exchange Format, or GPX | XML-based file format to exchange GPS data between Internet application and web services  <br>Classified into waypoint, route, and track, to indicate points and path information  |
