## Dashboard

You can check the inspection results in Inspection Item of Security Advisor.
The results of checking organizations are shown regardless of the selected region, and project resources show the results of checking resources created in the selected region.

* **Summary of Inspection Result** displays the number of inspection items by Alert Criteria.
  - **The alert criteria** described in the dashboard are the basic level of risk assessment.
The alert criteria for individual inspection items are applied differently for each item.
  - Among the detected resources in the selected inspection result, the total number of resources excluded from inspection is displayed in exception.
  - The auto inspection setting displays the inspection cycle set in the settings menu.
* **Short List of Inspection Result** displays the items of detected resources with Critical, High, Moderate, and Low criteria.
  - Inspection results in the **Low** state are not displayed.
  - Click **View** on View Details to move to the inspection item page and check detailed information.
* Click **Save as Excel** to download the inspection results to an excel file.
  - The Excel file stores the results of the last selected inspection item (basic information of the inspection item, detected resources, and inspection time).
  - The Excel file does not include excepted resources and configuration information.
  - If there is no inspection result because the selected inspection has not been performed even once after activating the service, the Excel file can be downloaded, but cannot open.
