## Container > Container Registry > Overview
NHN Cloud provides non-open source container registry service to safely and easily save, manage, and deploy Docker container images. 

NHN Cloud Container Registry supports Docker Image Manifest v2, and it applies the familiar docker command line (CLI) to manage images. It also provides the web console to search saved images and delete those that are not used any more.   

Integration with NHN Cloud Kubernetes is also available to easily implement user applications as containers.  


## Service Features 
* User container images are encrypted in HTTPS protocol for transfer and safely saved at a non-public cloud registry. 
* Based on NHN Cloud Object Storage, it is highly scalable and stable. Users don't need to consider storage volume to save container images as much as required. 
* By using the familiar Docker command line (CLI), container images can be easily saved and deployed to the environment you need. 
* It is easy to integrate the service with a Kubernetes-based container deployment environment.
