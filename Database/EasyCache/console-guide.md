## Database > EasyCache > Console User Guide

## Getting Started

To use EasyCache, you must create a replication group first.

## Replication Group

### Create a Replication Group

1. In the **Replication Group** tab on **Console > Database > EasyCache**, click **Create** and a **Create Replication Group** pop-up will show up.

   ![rep_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.06.04/rep_create_001.png)

2. Enter all required fields on the setting window and click **Create** at the bottom.

    * Replication Group Name: Enter name of a replication group.
    * Description: Enter description of the group.
    * Service Port: Enter the port number of Redis.
        * Available between 10000 and 12000.
    * Version: Select the version of Redis to create.
    * Instance Type: Select specifications for the replication group.
    * Max Memory: Adjust the max memory to prevent out-of-memory issues when running synchronization or backup.
        * You can change the size of max memory for a Redis server.
        * The size of memory for management can be also secured flexibly when needed.
    * Configuration Profile: Select a configuration file for Redis.
        * The default profile is provided.
        * More configuration profiles can be added for selection.
    * VPC Subnet: Select a subnet for Compute & Network to allow private network communication. Otherwise, it is set to the default network.
    * Set Password: Select whether to set a password. The default value is 'Set Password' (selected).
    * Auto Backup Setting: Select whether to use auto backup.
        * Backup Retention Period: Available from 1 day up to 30 days
        * Backup Start Time: Specify start time of backup, by 30-minute interval.
        * Backup Time: Backup starts randomly between start time and specified time. Available from 1 hour up to 3 hours.
3. Click **Create**.

4. Check inputs on the screen and click **Create**.
   Along with a replication group, a master node is created. It takes a few minutes to create.

##### Constraints
* Service is restricted for such commands that may severely impact service.
* See developer's guide to find out the commands.

### Replicate (Add Nodes)

By creating a replica node supported by Redis, availability can be raised.

1. To create a replica node, select an original replication group and click **Add Nodes**.

   ![nod_ad_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.06.04/rep_node_add_002.png)

2. To see if the master node has gone down, set wait time for health check response. Default is 3000ms.

3. Master node information can be checked.

4. Click **Add**, and a replica node is created.
5. To check information of the node, go to **Replication Groups > Node Information**.
   Replication relation is automatically set while it is created.

The replica node has the same server specifications as the original master node.
It may take more time to create a replica node, in proportion to the size of the original master node.

##### Constraints

* On the original master node, a maximum of 2 replica nodes can be created.
* If an abnormal Replica node is present, delete it first before adding a new Replica node.
* A replica node cannot create its own replica nodes under it.

#### High Availability (HA)

By adding a replica node to the standalone master node, high availability is automatically configured.

* By setting an auto failover, downtime can be reduced to the minimum when an error occurs on the master node.
* Failover refers to detecting a master node in which error has occurred and thereby automatically promoting a replica node to the master.
* You may find events on failure and status of the master or replica node.

##### Constraints

* If HA setting fails when adding 1 replica node, click the **Update HA** button in **Replication Group > Basic Information** to update the HA settings.

![rep_ha_error_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_ha_error_001.PNG)

* If HA settings fails to update when adding 2 replica node, click the **Update HA** button in **Replication Group > Basic Information ** to update the HA settings again.

* With a failover, the existing master node in which error occurred is suspended. When the failed node is deleted, it is changed into a general standalone master node in which high availability is not enabled.
* By adding a replica node to the standalone master node, high availability can be newly specified.
* The newly changed master node inherits the domain applied to access the existing master node.
* The existing node with failover becomes 'Disabled', under which, high availability is not enabled only with the new master node.

### Modify a Replication Group

1. Select an original replication group, and click **Modify**.
2. On the pop-up of **Modify Replication Group**, set name, backup period, and others.

![rep_mo_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_modify_002.PNG)

* Name of Replication Group: Name of a replication group can be changed.
* Description: Description of a replication group can be changed.
* Configuration Profile: Redis setting can be changed.
* Max Memory: Volume of the maximum memory for usage can be changed.

* Auto Backup Setting: Select whether to use auto backup.
    * Retention Period: Available from 1 day up to 30 days.
    * Backup Start Time: Specify start time of a backup, by 30-minute interval.
    * Backup Time: Backup to start randomly between start time and a specific time, from 1 hour up to 3 hours.

- The following is an item that can be found when a replica node is available.
    - Master Down Time: Wait time can be configured for a health check response to see if the master node is down; default is 3000ms.

3. Check changes and click **Change**.
   Service port, Redis Version, Instance Type, and Availability Area cannot be changed, once they're configured.
### Auto Backup

* Memory data (RDB file) is automatically backed up at a specific time once every day.
* To manage auto backups that are created, go to **Backup**.
* When a replication group bound for backup is deleted, backup files are deleted altogether.
* After a backup retention period, backup files will be automatically deleted.
* Auto backup is to start randomly between start time and backup time.

### Create Manual Backups

You may create a backup for replication group at a time of choice. Even if a replication group bound for backup is deleted, manual backup files cannot be deleted.

* Manage created manual backups from the **Backup** tab.
* Performance may be degraded while backup is executed.
* After a backup retention period, backup files will be automatically deleted.
* If a replication group bound for backup is deleted, details of the group are not displayed for basic information.

1. To create manual backup files, select a replication group and click **Manual Backup**.
2. Enter information for **Manual Backup** and click **Backup**.
   It may take more time to create a backup in proportion to the size of data.
   ![manual_backup_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_manual_backup_001.PNG)

* Backup Name: Enter name of a backup.
* Description: Enter description of a backup.
* Backup Retention Period: You may not delete, or retain backup from 1 day, up to 30 days.

### Configure Public Domains
* Access to a replication group is available only on instances sharing the same subnet; but to enable external access, configure public domain setting from domain management.

![manual_backup_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_public_domain_001.png)

### Read-only domain setup
* To set up a read-only domain, after selecting target replication group where a Replica node is added, click other action button (â‹¯) and click **Read-only Domain Setup**.
* The read-only domain you set is a private domain that can be logged in from the VPC subnet you selected when creating a replication group, and this is where the IP of the Replica node is bound to.
* Go to **Replication group > Login Information** if you want to check the read-only domain you set.
* If failover occurs due to the fault of the Master node
    * When there is 1 replica node
        * Until the old master node is recovered with the replica node or a new replica node is added after deleting the old one, the read-only domain retains the IP of the old replica node that has been promoted to the master node due to the failover.
        * If the old master node is recovered with the replica node or a new replica node is added after deleting the old one, the binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the new replica node.
            * If binding  fails, manually try again in Replication Group > Access Information.
    * When there are 2 replica nodes
        * The IP of the old replica node promoted to new master node is excluded from binding
        * When recovering an old master node that has been changed to a replica node or adding a new replica node after manually deleting it, the IP of the new replica node is added to the read-only domain.

* If Replica node fails or is deleted
    * When there is 1 replica node
        * The binding of the read-only domain changes to the IP of the master node.
        * When recovering a replica node or adding a new replica node after manually deleting it, the read-only domain binding changes to the IP of the new replica node.
            * If binding fails, manually try again in Replication Group > Access Information.
    * When there are 2 replica nodes
        * The IP of the replica node is excluded from the read-only domain.
        * When recovering a replica node or adding a new replica node after manually deleting it, the IP of the new replica node is added to the read-only domain binding.

* When deleting the replication group or disabling the service while set to read-only domain, the read-only domain is disabled.

##### Constraints
* When the binding of the read-only domain is changed
    * When binding is changed without login interruption (for instance, when new Replica node is added after failover of the Master node)
        * If the client logged in as a read-only domain supports the detection of binding change in domains or such logic is implemented, user will be logged in again using the changed binding IP. Otherwise, the user has to terminate the current login and log in again.
    * When binding change results in disconnection (e.g. when Replica node fails or is deleted)
        * If the client supports automatic relogin or such logic is implemented, user will be logged in with the changed binding IP. Otherwise, the user has to log in again.

### Import Data
* After selecting the replication group, click the other actions button(â‹¯), then the **Import Data** to import the data.

![data_import_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.06.14/data_import_001.png)

* The RDB file in the userâ€™s object storage can be imported to the node in use. The region of the object storage and EasyCache must be the same.
* When importing the data, the API endpoint settings of object storage, container, and the path to the RDB file is needed.
* For container and RDB file paths, only uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols -,_,/,. can be entered.
* After **Import Data**, back up is recommended before the previous data of the node gets deleted.
* Node cannot be used while executing **Import Data**. The execution status can be checked in events.
* Only the RDB files created in the same or previous version of EasyCache Redis can be imported. RDB file created in a newer version than the EasyCache Redis cannot be imported.

### Export Data
* After selecting the replication group, click Other Actions button(â‹¯), then the **Export Data** to export the data.

![data_export_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.07.02/data_export_001.png)

* You can export the data of the EasyCache replication groups to the userâ€™s object storage. In this case, the object storage and EasyCache must be in the same region.
* When exporting data, set the API endpoint for object storage and enter the path to the container to which the data will be exported and the prefix required to create a file name.
* For container paths and prefix, only uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols -,_,/,. can be entered.
* If the data in the EasyCache replication group is larger than 1 gigabyte, a segment object is automatically created when exporting to object storage.

### Change Instance Types

* It is available to change the instance type of a node in service.
* Change of an instance type means upgrading to higher specifications only.
* While a type change is underway, node is suspended  from service.
* With the change of instance type, data is reverted to a time of backup, and if backup was not available, data goes back to default.
* When there's a replica node, failover occurs to change instance type of the master node.

![instance_type_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.07.09/rep_instance_type_001.png)

##### Constraints

* Redundant manual backup is unavailable. Try again after current manual backup is done.
* Executing a manual backup during auto backup time may cause delays in the backup.

### Upgrade a Version
* You can upgrade an existing replication group that is Redis version 5 to Redis version 6.
* To run a version upgrade, select a target replication group that is Redis version 5, click the more actions button (â‹¯) and click **Upgrade Version**.
* In the **Upgrade Version** dialog, you can select the configuration profile that will be applied when upgrading the version.
* Performing data backup before running a version upgrade lets you protect against data loss and other contingencies.
* Running a version upgrade when the replication group's network traffic is low can increase the speed and reliability of the upgrade.

![version_up_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.10.29/version_up_001.png)

##### Constraints
* If the existing replication group to upgrade the Redis version has a custom configuration profile other than the default configuration profile applied, and you want to apply the same configuration profile when upgrading, create a custom configuration profile with Redis version 6 in **Profile Settings** in advance and select the corresponding configuration profile when upgrading the version.
* If a read-only domain is set, you can upgrade the version after clearing the read-only domain setting.
* For **standalone** type replication groups
    * Write operations to the replication group that occur during a version upgrade are excluded from data restoration target after upgrade.
    * If the Redis server is restarted during a version upgrade, read and write operations to the replication group become temporarily unavailable.
* For **replication** type replication groups
    * The master node is changed after a version upgrade.
    * During a version upgrade, read and write operations to the replication group are temporarily unavailable while the master change required for the upgrade is performed, and a failover event may occur.
    * Failover is not guaranteed while an HA node is being upgraded during a version upgrade.
* If the version upgrade fails, you can run the version upgrade again by clicking **Replication Group > â‹¯ > Upgrade Version**.

### Change Master

* After selecting the target replication group where a Replica node is added, click Other Action button(â‹¯) and click **Change Master** to change the master node of the replication group.
* The Replica node is changed to Master node, and the existing Master node is changed to Replica node.
* When there are 2 Replica nodes, change the Replica node appropriate for the system to Master node.

2. On the pop-up for **Create Alarm Rules**, specify the condition of sending an alarm and recipient groups.
   ![eve_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/21.09.16/alarm_002.png)

3. There are two alarm conditions: **Metric Condition** and **Event Condition**.

    * **Metric Condition**: You can specify alarm conditions using various performance indicators (see Monitoring) collected from the cache instance, and the following conditions can be specified.
        * Metric name, operator, type of collection, frequency of evaluation, threshold value
    * **Event Condition**: You can specify the event you want to be notified of among all events that occur within the service (see Event Items).

4. If it is difficult to determine the settings required for the **Metric Condition** and **Event Condition**, consider using the default template provided in **Alarm Template**.

    * **Default-Standalone**: Recommended alarm trigger conditions for replication groups operated as standalone
    * **Default- HA**: Recommended alarm trigger conditions for replication groups operated as replication

5. Click **View Recipient Groups** to check recipient groups or add more.

6. Alarm rules are basically applied to all replication groups. To create an alarm rule only for a specific replication group, specify the replication group for **Target Replication Groups**.

7. After setting is done, click **Create**.

The created alarm rules can be temporarily disabled by setting the alarm to 'Disabled.'
The alarm rules are applied to all regions.

### Recipient Groups

Alarm recipients can be managed under each group.

![not_re_001.PNG](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.04.28/alarm_004.PNG)

* To check recipient groups, click **View Recipient Groups**.
* If you don't have a group in need, click **Create Recipient Groups** to create a new group.
* Available recipients to be specified by each group are confined to project members only.
    * Messages can be mailed or texted to the email address or phone number registered for NHN Cloud membership.
* Note that, by deleting a current recipient group for alarm rules, no more alarms are to be sent, if there's no other recipient group.

The created receiver group can be used across all regions.

##### Constraints

* If there's only one replication group as the target of alarm rules, and if the group has been deleted from the replication group page, further alarms are to be sent to all replication groups because its only replication group is gone.
* If there's only one recipient group for alarm rules, and if the group has been deleted from the detail recipient group page, no further alarms can be sent because its only recipient group is gone.
* Alarms for the creation of a replication group are sent for all replication groups, even if there's a target replication group.
* If a new user is added to a project, about an hour of wait time may be incurred until the user is synchronized to the list of project users of a recipient group.
* Even when an alarm rule specifies a specific replication group in the target replication group, alarm rules without specified replication group will be synchronized in other regions and they will be applied to all regions.

## Events

1. Select **Event**.

2. EasyCache automatically retains significant events occurred at a replication group.

## Appendix 1. Guide for EasyCache Restart for Hypervisor Maintenance

* To restart a EasyCache node, use the **Restart** feature in the console.
* With the restart feature of a replication group, the node is not moved to a different hypervisor. Use the restart feature in the console according to the following guideline.

### 1. Go to a project where the node specified as a maintenance target is included.

### 2. Check the maintenance target replication group.

* The replication group with **!Restart** icon on the side is the replication group including the maintenance target node.

![migration_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/migration_001.png)

* By hovering the mouse cursor on the **!Restart** icon, you can see the detailed maintenance schedule.

![migration_002.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/migration_002.png)

### 3. Check the type of the maintenance target node.

* Depending on the node type, the impact of restart on service is as follows:
    * MASTER: The restart feature can be used after changing the master node to replica node by selecting **Replication Group > Change Master**. Standalone type can be used without change.
    * REPLICA : No impact on service.
    * HA: During restart, failover is not guaranteed and a failover event may occur.

* If it is determined that the service is affected by the node move, please contact the NHN Cloud customer center and we will guide you through the appropriate action.

### 4. Select the maintenance target replication group, and click the !Restart icon on the right side to restart the maintenance node.

![migration_003.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/migration_003.png)

* When there are multiple maintenance nodes, only one node is restarted at a time. The HA node is restarted first and then the Replica node is restarted.

* In case of a standalone type, when restart occurs, it returns to the data at the time of backup. If backup was not performed, data is reset.

* If the replication's master node is the maintenance target, it cannot be used immediately. Change the master node to a replica node and restart it.

### 5. Wait until the status indicator of the replication group changes to blue color and !Restart icon disappears.

* While a replication group is being restarted, the replication group cannot be operated.

## Appendix 2. Guide for Internet Gateway Restart for Server Maintenance

* To restart a internet gateway, use the **Restart Internet Gateway** feature in the console.
* Use the restart feature in the console according to the following guideline.

### 1. Go to a project where the internet gateway specified as a maintenance target is included.

![gm_001.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/gm_001.png)

### 2. Check the maintenance target replication group tab.

* Check the **!Restart Internet Gateway** icon on the far right of the Replication Groups tab.
* By hovering the mouse cursor on the **!Restart Internet Gateway** icon, you can see the detailed maintenance schedule.

![gm_002.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/gm_002.png)

### 3. Click the !Restart Internet Gateway icon displayed on the right side of the maintenance target replication group to restart the maintenance node.

![gm_003.png](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_easycache/20.12.01/gm_003.png)

### 4. Wait until the !Restart Internet Gateway icon disappears.

* After restart, nodes using public domain cannot access external networks. Nodes that are not using public domain are not affected.
* The time required for restart is approximately 1 minute. The restarted internet gateway runs on a device where maintenance has been completed.
