## Server Dashboard

You can visualize performance metrics in chart form on the server dashboard. Charts are arranged according to a preset layout. Metrics s are collected once every minute and kept for up to five years. Metrics data is aggregated as average values over 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, and a day. Retention period by aggregation unit is as follows.

| Aggregate Unit | Retention Period |
|----------------|------------------| 
| 1 minute       | 7 days           |
| 5 minutes      | 1 month          |
| 30 minutes     | 6 months         |
| 2 hours        | 2 years          |
| 1 day          | 5 years          |

## Layout

Use a layout to show the size and position of charts. When the service is enabled, 2 layouts are provided by default, `Default system index` and `Default MariaDB index`. Default layouts cannot be changed or deleted and you cannot add charts or change or delete charts that have been added. If you want to view charts in addition to the default layouts, you can create a layout and add charts.

* ❶ You can select multiple charts that you want to add by checking the check box.
* ❷ When you click a chart name, a chart preview appears in the red square area on the left.
* ❸ Click **Add** to add all selected charts.

### Change and Delete Charts in Layout

* ❷ You can resize the chart by dragging and dropping the bottom right area of the chart.
* ❸ When you click **x** in the upper right corner of the chart, the chart is deleted from the layout.

## Chart

You can view various performance metrics for DB instance in chart form. Each performance metric consists of a different type of chart. In addition to default system metrics, MariaDB provides various performance metrics in chart form. Metrics that can be found for each chart are as follows.

## Server Group

Server group allows you to view performance metrics for multiple DB instances in a single chart. Performance metrics appear in a single chart for each DB instance that belongs to a server group. Charts that consist of multiple performance metrics are all changed to individual performance metrics across server groups.

### Create Server Group

![chart_01_en](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds/23.04.11/chart_01_en.png)

* ❶ **Add Group** displays a pop-up window where you can create groups.
* ❷ Select DB instance to add to server groups.

### Server Group Settings

DB instances and server groups appear together in the list of servers on the left side of the server dashboard.

![server_group_01_en](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds/23.04.11/server_group_01_en.png)

* ❶ Click **+**, **-** to unfold or close the server group.
* ❷ When you click DB instance that belongs to a server group, a color selection pop-up appears where you can change the color that will appear in the chart.

![server_group_02_en](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_rds/23.04.11/server_group_02_en.png)

* ❶ **:You can change or delete the server group by clicking **.
