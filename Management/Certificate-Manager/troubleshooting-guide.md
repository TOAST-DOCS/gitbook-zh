## Converting Certificate File Formats

Certificate Manager currently supports only the pem-format certificate files.

  * More formats are to be supported in the near future.

Following are the available certificate file formats for Certificate Manager.  

### Format of Certificate File (.pem)

The filename extension is **.pem**. 

Each file includes certificate (chain) information and private key information. 

``` text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### How to Create PEM Files 

You can create pem files like follows:
1. Convert certificate information into pem. 
2. Create a single pem file which includes certificate chain and a private key. 

#### Convert Certificate Information into PEM

1. In case of a Java JKS or JCEKS certificate, use `keytool` to convert certificate into the `.p12` or `.pks` format. 
2. For the `.p12` or  `.pks` type, execute the command as follows and convert it into  `.pem` .

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -in my_certificate_input_file.pfx -nokeys -out my_cert_converting_result_file.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in my_certificate_input_file.pfx -nodes -nocerts -out my_cert_converting_result_file.pem
```

* See the link below for the **openssl** command which is applied to convert certificate formats. 
    * openssl command guide : [https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html)
* See the link as below on how to use keytool. 
    * java-1.6.0 keytool : [https://linux.die.net/man/1/keytool-java-1.6.0-openjdk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/keytool-java-1.6.0-openjdk)
    * java-1.7.0 keytool : [https://linux.die.net/man/1/keytool-java-1.7.0-openjdk](https://linux.die.net/man/1/keytool-java-1.7.0-openjdk)

#### (Optional) Convert into RSA Private Key Type

If a private key is not in the RSA format, encode it into an RSA private key format.

* When a private key file is open and if it starts with **-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----**, it is not an RSA private key file.  

To convert a private key into an RSA private key, execute the following command: 

``` bash
openssl rsa -in my_key_not_rsa_input_file.pem -check -out my_key_rsa_converting_result_file.pem

> writing RSA key
> Enter PEM pass phrase: (enter passphrase encoded with RSA private key)
> Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
```

#### Create Single PEM Files including Certificate Chain and Private Key

Combine PEM file information of certificate and private key, to create a single PEM file. 

``` bash
cat my_cert_converting_result_file.pem my_key_rsa_converting_result_file.pem > final_result_pem_file.pem
```

The format of a newly-made PEM file (which is "final\_result\_pem\_file.pem" in the above example) is like below. 

``` text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... (your primary SSL certificate)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... (the intermediate CA certificate)
.... (unavailable if certificate chain information does not exist.)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
.... (the trusted root certificate)
.... (unavailable if certificate chain information does not exist.)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
