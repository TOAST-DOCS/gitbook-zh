## Notification > Push > Console Guide

In order to use Push service, you need other push service certificates.
Currently, we support following push services:
- GCM - Google Cloud Messaging (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- APNS - Apple Push Notification Service
- ADM - Amazon Device Messaging

## Certificate Management

To manage certificates, go to **Notification > Push > Certificates** from the menu.

### GCM API Key

To send push notification to Android devices, you need valid GCM project's API Key.

#### Create and Import Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM) API Key

1. Sign in to [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Choose **Add Project**.
3. Complete the form and click **Create Project**.
4. Click on the Gear icon on the first page of the project.
5. Click **Project Settings**.
6. Choose **Cloud Messaging** tab on the **Settings** page.
7. Check your **Server Key** (API Key) and **Sender ID**.

#### Register FCM API Key

1. Go to **Console > Notification > Push** and click the **Certificates** tab.
2. Copy the FCM API Key just created and paste it to the  **GCM API Key**, and press **Register** to complete.

#### Caution for Google Project
- Google is scheduled to [deprecate GCM service]((https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/faq)) as of April 11, 2019.

- If the key created from Google Project (now, Google Cloud Platform) is currently used as GCM API Key, it may not be valid in the future. In such case, the Google Project must be migrated to Firebase and a new key must be created through Firebase.
	- Google provides [Firebase Migration Guide](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/android-migrate-fcm).

##### Migrating from Google Project to Firebase

1. Go to [Google Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Choose **CREATE NEW PROJECT**.
3. When there is a Google Project in service, the Project Name shows it on the list; choose the Google Project to migrate.
4. The new Firebase Project ID will be identical with the existing Google Project.  
5. Click on the Gear icon on the first page of the project.
6. Click **Project Settings**.
7. Click the **CLOUD MESSAGING** tab on the page.
8. Check your Server Key (API Key) and Sender ID.
9. Copy the Server Key at Firebase to **GCM API Key** in the **Certificates** tab.

### APNS Certificate

To send push notification to iOS devices, you need APNS certificate generated from Apple Developer website.

### Create and Import APNS Certificate

1. Run **Keychain Access** app on Mac.
2. Choose **Access Keychain > Support Certificates > Request a Certificate** from **Certificate Authority**.
3. Enter information as required such as Apple Developer’s ID at **User's Email Address**, choose **Disk Saved**, and **I have saved key pair information**, and click **Continue**.
4. Choose the key size and algorithm at **Key Pair Information** and click **Continue**. Then, a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file is created.
5. Go to [Apple Developer Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateList.action).
6. Click **+**(Add) at the top right to go to the page issuing Certificates.
7. Choose **Select Type > Request > Generate** tab to upload CSR files made through **Keychain** and click **Generate**.
8. You can create and download a certificate. If not authorized, you can obtain an authority to download.
9. Download the certificate and select it in **Keychain > Certificates**.
10. Right-mouse click on the certificate and choose **Send**.
11. Choose save location and press **Save** (file format: .p12).
12. Enter password to protect exported items, and the certificate is ready.


### Register APNS Certificate

1. Click **Notification > Push > Certificates** on Console.
2. Click **Select File** at **APNS Certificate > Certificates**.
3. Enter certificate password at **Password** .
4. Click **Register**.

### Caution for APNS
#### Differences between APNS (Production) and APNS_SANDBOX (Development)

- Applications built with Production Provisioning Profile must use APNS (Production) while those built with Development Provisioning Profile must use APNS_SANDBOX (Development). Otherwise, push messages may not be properly received. 
- In most failure cases of message delivery, the APNS certificate registered at NHN Cloud Push has a different provisioning profile for application buildup.
   APNS(Production) = Production Provisioning Profile
   APNS_SANDBOX(Development) = Development Provisioning Profile 
- For more details, refer to the following:     
  [APNS Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1)     
  [App Distribution Quick Start](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013839)

#### Causes of Delivery Failure of APNS Messages

- When a certificate has been expired
- When a wrong certificate has been registered
- When a push message has been rejected by the application
- When there’s no Internet access

### ADM Credentials

To send push notification to Kindle Fire app, you need its Client ID and Client Secret.

### Register ADM Application and Profiles (Acquire Client Id and Client Secret)
1. Go to [ADM Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html).
2. Click **APP & SERVICES** at the top left and choose **Add a New App** at the bottom.
3. When the app is created, click **Device Messaging** in the middle. Then, click **Create a New Security Profile**.
4. When the profile is created, click **Security Profiles** in the middle and choose **View Security Profile**.
5. Go to the **General** tab to check Client ID and Client Secret.

To add UIDs on to the tag:
1. Click **Add**.
2. Type in the UIDs with new line as a delimiter.  
	- Up to 1,000 UIDs can be added.

<span id="stats-event-key"></span>

## Statistics Event Key Management 
Statistics event keys can be managed from the **Statistics Event Key Management** tab. You may set the name, description, and event collection period. Without configuring event collection period, the collection period is set as indefinite. Once created, a statistics event key can be setup for message delivery. Delivery results of messages to which a statistics event key is configured can be searched with the statistics event key from the **Statistics** tab. 

<span id="stats"></span>

## Statistics
You may search data on received/checked messages that are collected for the last 30 days. Select **Statistics** from the console, and you can search statistics on registration or deletion of a message or a token.   

1. Set period as part of a search condition. 
    - Manual setting is available other than simple period setting, between 1 minute and 30 days. 
2. Set a display method of graphs in each type. 
    - By default, graph is displayed in automatically optimized type for each period setting. 
3. From message statistics, you can search by statistics event key or push type. 

## Token Setting

You can configure Push service.

Go to **Console > Notification > Push** > and click **Setting** to set Token Expiration Period and App Type. 

### Position Setting of Ad Phrase

- You can configure the position of the Ad phrase displayed on the advertisement push notification. 
- Title
    - Default 
    - '(Ad)' will be prepended in the title along with contact information.
- Body
    - '(Ad)' phrase, contact information, and unsubscription method will be displayed in the body.

### Token Setting

- Token Expiration Period
    - Exclude tokens that did not request registration during set period from the list of message delivery.
    - Default is 12 months.
    - Tokens of the users who do not use the app during the period are automatically excluded from the message delivery list, thus saving costs.  

- App Type
    - Manage tokens by the type of the app.
    - Multiple Tokens
        - Default
        - User can use the app installed on many devices all at once, and a user can have multiple tokens.  
        - For instance, if a user has a mobile phone and a tablet PC, he can have two tokens, and push messages are delivered to both of the devices.
    - Single Token
        - User can use app on one device only and a user can have only one token.
        - For instance, if a user has a mobile phone and a tablet PC, he can have only one token, and push messages are delivered to one of the two.

### Collect Message Receipt/Check Data

- Message Delivery Receipt can be enabled. 
- SDK v1.4 or higher versions must be applied to operate activated features. 
- Collected data are available on the **Statistics** tab. 
- Data collection time is calculated on device. 
- It may take approximately many minutes until a feature is actually applied. 

<span id="low-received-event-rates"></span>
#### Causes for Low Indicators of Message Receiving Data    
1. When message notification is not enabled on the app 
Unless the user enables message notifications with OS (iOS or Android) level setup on initial app execution, message receiving events cannot be collected. 
(The average rate of notification enabled, as of 2018, is 43.9% for iOS and 91.1% for Android.) 
<a href="https://www.accengage.com/press-release-accengage-releases-the-push-notification-benchmark-2018/" target="_blank">source accengage</a>)
2. When token expiration of a deleted app is delayed 
Some apps are deleted but not directly lead into token expiration. 
If token is delayed for expiration, messages may be delivered but receiving events cannot be collected, since app has been deleted.  
3. When it is disconnected to the internet for a long time 
If it is not connected to the internet, due to various reasons, including phone being turned off, in the energy-saving mode, or in network grey area, 
both message receiving and event collecting are unavailable.  
4. When it fails to collect receiving events 
Even if a message has been received, it may not be properly collected depending on the OS or network environment 
when the receiving event is sent to server.  

### Log Message Delivery History
- Send message delivery history to Log & Crash Search as specified.
- **Appkey**: Enter Appkey from Log & Crash Search service.
- **Log Source**: Enter a value to log along with history logging, as a separator from other logs.
- **Log Level**: Record specific parts only from the delivery history:
    - ALL: Log all history, including success/failure of delivery.
    - INFO: Log delivery, and failed delivery of expired tokens only: do not log successful deliveries.
    - ERROR: Log history of failed deliveries only.
