#### Filter by Country

Required to enter a language code when registering a token. You can also specify a country to send messages to.

#### Common Message Format

When a message is written on a common format, it is adjusted to each device before delivered.
Likewise, the ready-made common message format of a language code can be applied to any new messages for a corresponding language code and device.

#### Deliver Advertising Messages

For advertising messages, it is obliged to specifically show in the push messages.  

When delivering an advertising message (advertisement), include contact information and how to cancel subscription.
Follow each device's language setting to decide whether to insert advertising messages.
Only the devices configured in Korean (of which the language code starts with ko, or ko-KR) are required to insert advertising messages, in accordance with Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc.

#### Deliver Scheduled Messages  

Many types of scheduled message delivery are available, such as once, daily, weekly and monthly delivery.  

You may also deliver on local time basis.

#### Configure Time to Live (TTL)   

Your messages can be setup with Time-to-live, or TTL. When a message remains undelivered beyond TTL, it is processed as a failure.
However, ‘0’ has no TTL and hence, deemed not as a failure due to delivery delay.  

#### Monitor in Real-time
